  Pig Game
  
This is a two player based game that I have created based on a Udemy course entitled "The Complete JavaScript Course"
  
  How to Play

The first player rolls the dice and the respective value gets added to their current score. One has the option either to roll again, or to hold, in which case the current score gets added to the total score and the other player becomes active, meaning that it's their turn to roll. The idea is that when a player rolls a 1, the current score at that moment will be lost, no points get added to their total score and they lose their turn. Whoever reaches 100 first wins. Have fun!
